<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm an engineer who enjoys drawing, watching movies, and programming(I'm still a beginner,
  but I enjoy learning it). I enjoy picking up new skills, solving problems, and bringing ideas to life(art).
Sports wise, I'm into basketball, and boxing(still a beginner, but can't wait to get back to it). Always curious and ready for the next challenge. </p>
